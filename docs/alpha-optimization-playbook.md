# Alpha Optimization Playbook

Last refreshed: 2026-06-10.

This is Ginger's long-lived alpha research playbook. It is not an experiment
log. Detailed trial records belong in `docs/experiment_log.jsonl`,
`experiments/logs/*.json`, experiment cards, and artifacts. This file keeps the
current operating readout, research queue, frozen retry zones, and anti-repeat
rules. Mechanism cards and external research notes live in linked detail files.

For default LLM context, start with `docs/alpha_context_pack.md`, then
`docs/current_state_snapshot.md` when current-state orientation is needed.
These are generated short memory surfaces; this playbook remains the durable
policy and research-prior reference. Mechanism-specific short lessons live
under `docs/lessons/*.md` and should be refreshed with:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -B scripts\build_alpha_memory.py --git-ref HEAD
```

North-star metric:

```text
expected_value_score = strategy_total_return_pct * sharpe_daily
```

## Operating Rules

Before strategy-affecting work, answer:

1. What is the alpha hypothesis, and is it entry, exit, ranking, capital
   allocation, candidate-pool, LLM event scoring, or risk allocation?
2. Has the same or adjacent family been tried before, and what failed?
3. What is the one changed decision hypothesis or fixed policy bundle, and
   which edits are only implementation/parity/live-realism work needed to
   evaluate it?
4. What Gate 1-4 standard from `docs/backtesting.md` decides acceptance?
5. If it fails, can the next agent reproduce the trial from repository records?

Priority rules:

- Prefer `alpha_search` unless a measurement gap directly blocks a high-value
  alpha test.
- Prefer new production-visible fields over threshold/scalar sweeps.
- Prefer default-off paper adapters before core or live expansion.
- For any alpha that may become live-capital eligible, include the live-realistic
  execution envelope in the experiment rather than postponing it: notional,
  capital cap, liquidity/slippage, portfolio displacement, exposure limits,
  kill switch, and order semantics.
- Prefer replacement value against the displaced candidate over standalone PnL.
- Prefer shared-paper-first experiments for high-potential default-off paper
  alpha: the first serious test should use a shared historical replay plus daily
  snapshot helper, not private runner-only selection code. The default runnable
  form is the full-stack candidate-pool contract
  (`--change-type candidate_pool_full_stack`, see
  `docs/agent_experiment_protocol.md`), which reaches a paper-sleeve verdict in
  one experiment instead of a scout round plus a promotion round.
- Prefer shared production/backtest policy over replay-only logic. A positive
  private replay scout is only a lead until a shared helper reproduces it.
- Treat high aggregate EV with window regression or drawdown drift as a rejected
  clue, not as a retained strategy.

## Current Readout

The strongest current pattern is not more filters. It is:

1. find broad, cheap, point-in-time candidate sources;
2. when the idea is credible, test it through a shared-paper-first helper that
   can drive both historical replay and daily default-off snapshots;
3. define the live-realistic execution envelope early, even while
   `trade_enabled=false`;
4. collect closed forward replacement-value rows under that envelope;
5. if the envelope was already measured and remains unchanged, live enablement
   is a release checklist/config change; otherwise run only a narrow
   activation-envelope Gate 1-4, not a new alpha search.

Private replay scouts should be reserved for uncertain data-shape discovery or
very speculative ideas. They should not be treated as accepted alpha even when
Gate 4 is positive; the next retained asset must be the shared helper or daily
default-off wiring that reproduces the lead.

Meta-research continues to rank production-visible default-off paper adapters
above raw filters, ticker exceptions, and cap releases. The research report is
queue guidance only; it is not a trading signal.

The June 6-8 readout tightens the rule: relation-aware free-data candidate
sources can work, but only when the relation itself is the edge. Accepted
examples use macro-event relief, volatility-relief leadership,
rolling-correlation peer shock with core-flow confirmation, or
industry-relative laggard repair. Rejected neighbors show what does not count
as a new relation: sector ETF laggards, core-selected anchor peer lags with
zero target trades, short-horizon reversal/reclaim, macro sector confirmation
that fails versus the accepted comparator, broad cross-asset proxies, and SEC
guidance/outlook phrase matching with same-day price alignment. These are
mostly weak confirmers, not new information.

The June 8 batch adds a sharper boundary. Copper strength, oil-cost relief,
IWM breadth thrust, DIA/MDY "real economy" leadership, and simple VIX/SPY/QQQ
tail guards did not create enough after-cost next-open replacement value. The
one useful lead was not another broad proxy: it was a narrower
industry-stable-leadership source admitted only when the existing core A/B stack
also had same-day entry flow and same-ticker overlap was excluded. Treat this
as evidence that relation alpha needs an internal flow or displacement anchor,
not just a macro ETF or commodity tape label.

The late June 8 and June 9 readout adds two more rules. First, narrow-range
compression can be useful when the full policy bundle is fixed: prior range
compression, signal-day range expansion, high close-location, volume
confirmation, SPY-relative trend, next-open entry, 10-day exit, costs,
cooldown, and core-overlap exclusion. Second, most intuitive "institutional
demand" relabels are still too generic. Gap-and-hold, breadth-confirmed
gap-and-hold, post-thrust inside-day absorption, accumulation-base variants,
market-pullback reclaim, and extra core-flow or volatility-relief confirmation
did not beat the accepted comparators. Treat these as evidence that price
formation labels need an independent displacement edge, not just cleaner
momentum vocabulary.

The June 10 readout makes the allocator lesson sharper. A source-priority
allocator across already accepted default-off helpers can add value when it
chooses one ex-ante highest-priority paper row per day and avoids same-ticker
overlap. Revision-surprise low-extension earned a fixed rank-5 slot inside that
allocator because it supplied distinct expectation evidence. Simple additions
of already accepted helpers, such as macro relief, 52-week-high, or
post-earnings rows, did not add enough incremental replacement value after
higher-priority rows and cooldown. Calendar and event labels also narrowed:
turn-of-month leadership remains accepted, while OPEX week, quarter-end,
holiday-adjacent, pre-earnings DTE/low-bar, broad SEC business-update labels,
Companyfacts quality gates layered onto 52-week anchors, and extra compression
tail gates did not beat accepted comparators. A fixed semiconductor/AI hardware
basket breadth-thrust scout was also rejected despite positive aggregate EV
because it regressed old_thin, failed concentration, and did not beat the
accepted source-priority allocator. The useful question is now source
arbitration and distinct evidence, not more date labels, helper stacking, or
hand-built theme baskets.

Default next question for any new broad candidate pool:

- what exact relation makes this ticker a better replacement than cash, ETF
  substitute, or the already accepted default-off comparator;
- whether the relation is point-in-time and production-visible;
- whether the candidate improves all windows against the accepted comparator,
  not only against the core baseline;
- whether the result survives costs, concentration, and drawdown before any
  notional, top-N, hold-day, or cooldown tuning.

## Detail Sources

Generated mechanism memory lives in `docs/lessons/*.md`; exact facts live in
`experiments/tickets`, `experiments/logs`, `experiments/cards`,
`experiments/artifacts`, and committed code.

External research mappings live in `docs/alpha_external_research_map.md`.

Use detail sources only when choosing or auditing a concrete family. Keep this
playbook focused on the current operating readout, queue, and anti-repeat
rules.

## Research Queue

### 1. Forward Maturation Of Accepted Default-Off Adapters

Highest-value near-term work is not another replay sweep. It is forward
evidence on accepted paper adapters:

- low-deployment ETF cash substitute;
- lagged independent free-data consensus;
- SEC FTD + FINRA confirmation;
- FINRA/IWM borrow-pressure;
- post-earnings underpriced drift;
- Fundamental Growth RS;
- macro relief, volatility relief, rolling-correlation peer shock,
  industry-relative laggard repair, industry-stable core-flow,
  narrow-range compression breakout, turn-of-month liquid leadership, and
  52-week-high proximity core-flow (full-stack
  `accepted_paper_pending_forward`, exp-20260610-008);
- accepted-helper source-priority allocator with revision-surprise
  low-extension as fixed rank 5;
- VBB / VCP / Space observe-only buckets where nonzero forward rows exist.

Minimum forward package:

- candidate id and source family;
- exact displaced candidate or cash alternative;
- cost-adjusted replacement value;
- closed 5/10/20-day outcome where relevant;
- concentration and top-contributor share;
- replay-vs-forward parity status;
- reason no live order was placed.

### 2. Tail-State Classifier For Momentum And Broad Candidate Pools

Broad recent-winner, gap-and-hold, post-thrust inside-day, accumulation-base,
and market-pullback reclaim tests suggest a real but crowded continuation
surface with unacceptable tail/comparator risk. The next experiment should be
diagnostic/field-building before adapter promotion.

Candidate fields:

- `winner_continuation_tail_state_bucket`
- `momentum_crash_regime_bucket`
- `candidate_gap_chase_decay_bucket`
- `ret5_ret20_extension_ratio_bucket`
- `market_breadth_support_bucket`
- `same_day_displacement_candidate_type`
- `accepted_etf_substitute_comparator_delta`
- `cost_adjusted_drawdown_contribution_bucket`
- `gap_hold_event_absorption_quality_bucket`
- `post_thrust_pause_quality_bucket`
- `compression_breakout_tail_state_bucket`

Acceptance path:

- first read-only attribution;
- then default-off paper only if tail-state separation beats the low-deployment
  ETF and accepted compression/relation comparators after costs and drawdown.

### 3. Relation-Aware Event / Peer Fields

Local same-ticker SEC recurrence and same-sector peer transfer have failed.
Future event graph work must improve the relation, not the event count.
Recent OHLCV relation work adds positive templates: rolling-correlation peer
shock with core-flow confirmation, industry-relative lag plus same-day repair,
industry-stable leadership with core-flow admission, and volatility/macro
relief leadership. Recent failures add the negative template: sector/ETF
labels, core-selected anchors, negative peer shocks, SEC-provenanced peer
shocks, characteristic-similar same-industry shocks, and generic peer lag are
not enough.

Candidate relation sources:

- characteristic-similarity peers built from sector, fundamentals, liquidity,
  momentum, analyst coverage, and event history;
- customer/supplier or contract counterparties when source text supports it;
- early peer earnings reaction;
- source-family propagation with explicit timestamp and source provenance;
- dynamic correlation or hypergraph edges with explicit as-of dates, decay, and
  relation type;
- correlation-network stress clusters for risk first, not direct alpha.

Minimum fields:

- `peer_relation_source_bucket`
- `peer_similarity_method_id`
- `peer_edge_weight`
- `peer_edge_asof_timestamp`
- `peer_relation_pit_valid_flag`
- `early_peer_event_age_trading_days`
- `peer_transfer_strength_score`
- `relation_displacement_value_bucket`
- `accepted_relation_comparator_id`
- `relation_edge_failure_mode`
- `dynamic_relation_edge_decay_bucket`
- `relation_graph_high_order_cluster_id`
- `relation_source_provenance_hash`

Acceptance path:

- first compare against the closest accepted relation comparator, such as
  rolling-correlation peer shock, macro relief leadership, volatility relief,
  industry-relative laggard repair, or industry-stable core-flow;
- require displacement value after costs, not only standalone paper PnL;
- if the relation is production-visible and PIT-safe, use shared-paper-first
  instead of a private replay scout.

### 4. Expectation Revision With Real PIT Trajectory

Analyst/estimate revision remains promising but proxy-grade. Current frozen
snapshot evidence is not enough.

Needed fields:

- EPS and revenue revision velocity;
- analyst-count delta;
- estimate dispersion change;
- guidance raise/cut language;
- surprise-history adjustment;
- PEAD bucket with PIT `last_earnings_date`;
- source freshness and created-after-asof blockers.

Accepted default-off observation: `exp-20260610-014` admits
`revision_surprise_low_extension` as fixed rank 5 inside the shared
accepted-helper source-priority allocator. Do not retune revision rank,
revision thresholds, allocator top-N, notional, hold, or cooldown on frozen
windows.

Only promote revision-driven behavior to live trading after the PIT revision
source and forward replacement rows are available.

### 5. LLM As Bounded Semantic Infrastructure

LLM remains useful for event understanding, not direct trading authority.

Allowed roles:

- classify event type, source credibility, semantic direction, and uncertainty;
- bind evidence spans to source documents;
- produce structured, replayable fields for paper attribution;
- explain catastrophic risk cases for operator review.

Forbidden without separate Gate 1-4:

- direct buy/sell instructions;
- sizing, slot, exit, or risk-budget authority;
- hidden reliance on facts not present in prompt/log/archive.

Minimum LLM field standard:

1. schema-bound JSON;
2. source id, timestamp, and evidence span;
3. ontology/schema version;
4. retrieval/parse/reasoning failure buckets;
5. production artifact visibility;
6. PIT replay safety;
7. chronological evaluation before strategy use.

Near-term implication from 2026 research: LLM and agent systems should be
treated as auditable evidence-processing infrastructure. The useful product is
not an autonomous trade call; it is a timestamped, schema-bound, retrievable
field with source coverage, calibration, uncertainty, and failure-mode metadata.
If the field cannot be replayed or compared against a displaced candidate after
costs, keep it out of trading logic.

## Anti-Repeat Rules

Do not repeat these without forward rows or a materially different
production-visible field:

- broad filter/gate tightening on the core stack;
- simple risk scalar / top-up sweeps;
- state-surface rank/profile/notional retunes below the hard EV threshold;
- ticker-specific exceptions from one or two trades;
- simple target, stop, time-stop, or fixed max-loss exit changes;
- LLM direct buy/sell/sizing/exit authority;
- raw full-universe `alpha_score` top-N or weight tuning;
- broad OHLCV factor mining that only rediscovers momentum;
- commodity/ETF/macro proxy leadership variants that merely relabel broad beta
  or cyclical beta;
- fixed theme-basket breadth/thrust variants, including semiconductor/AI
  hardware baskets, unless supported by new PIT ETF/constituent/catalyst,
  borrow/options/ownership, or forward replacement-value evidence;
- OPEX-week, quarter-end, holiday-adjacent, or other calendar leadership
  variants unless the new date field beats turn-of-month and the accepted
  allocator after costs in every canonical window;
- pre-earnings liquid leadership, low-bar, DTE, or earnings-calendar timing
  variants unless a new PIT expectation-trajectory field is present;
- broad 5-day winner continuation variants unless they solve drawdown/tail and
  beat the accepted low-deployment ETF comparator;
- gap-and-hold, breadth-confirmed gap-and-hold, post-thrust inside-day
  absorption, accumulation-base, quiet high-close accumulation, and
  market-pullback reclaim variants unless they add a new independent
  production-visible displacement field and beat accepted compression/relation
  comparators;
- extra core-flow, VIXY/volatility-relief, or breadth confirmation layered on
  an already accepted candidate source unless it improves all windows versus
  that accepted source, not only the core baseline;
- adding an already accepted standalone helper as another source-priority
  allocator row unless the added source has distinct evidence and improves all
  windows versus the current allocator;
- low-deployment ETF threshold, ETF-list, hold-day, or notional retunes;
- lagged free-data consensus source-set/source-family/timing/notional retunes
  that do not beat the accepted lagged independent-family comparator;
- FINRA/IWM, SEC FTD, borrow-pressure, top-N, cooldown, hold, or notional
  retunes without a new PIT borrow-cost / availability source;
- Companyfacts support-scalar mining, quality-gated top-1 replacement,
  same-industry peer confirmation, fresh-underreaction, or dual-growth
  threshold variants;
- post-earnings high-liquidity, sector-residual, core-overlap, DTE, latest
  surprise, average surprise, pre-event RS, score, rank, or scalar retunes;
- SEC item-code / phrase / same-day absorption retries without richer semantic
  provenance or relation structure;
- broad SEC business-update labels, including generic 8-K Item 8.01/7.01/1.01
  leadership, without richer event semantics or relation provenance;
- raw SEC same-family bursts, first/follow-on recurrence, same-ticker
  cross-family transitions, same-sector SEC peer transfer, or same-sector
  event breadth retries;
- sector-level, same-industry characteristic-similar, negative-shock, or
  SEC-provenanced peer-shock retries unless the relation edge is stronger than
  rolling-correlation peer shock and has explicit PIT provenance;
- Form 4 owner-count or liquidity-intensity retries without forward
  replacement value;
- Space price-action, ETF relative, defense-budget, low-thrust absorption, or
  theme-segment retunes on frozen windows;
- missing archive/text availability as an alpha field.

## Update Discipline

Update this file only when a result changes mechanism-level priors, freezes a
research family, changes the next 1-3 research queues, or adds external
research that maps to concrete replayable fields. Keep experiment details in
the logs.
