Please update the news filtering logic with the following additional rules:

1. Maintain a fixed WATCHLIST (e.g. NVDA, AAPL, MSFT, SPY).
   Drop any news item whose tickers do not intersect with the watchlist.

2. Implement a simple event keyword filter:
   - Keep items whose title or summary contains at least one of:
     earnings, guidance, forecast, acquisition, lawsuit, investigation,
     approval, downgrade, upgrade, raises, cuts
   - Drop items containing obvious market-summary keywords such as:
     dow, s&p, nasdaq, market, stocks rally, live updates

3. Log how many items are dropped by each rule.

Output the final filtered items to:
data/clean_trade_news_YYYYMMDD.json
