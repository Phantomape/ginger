Please add a news hygiene / filtering step to the project.

Requirements:
1. Drop any news item older than 72 hours based on published_at
2. Drop any item with empty tickers
3. Deduplicate items by (ticker + source), keeping the most recent
4. Output cleaned news to:
   data/clean_news_YYYYMMDD.json

This step must be deterministic and not use any LLM.
Log how many items were dropped for each rule.
